The statemachines example in package statemachine.* consists of a simulated 
development sequence of 3 statemachines. The development sequence is indicated 
by the package names: statemachine.year1 corresponds to a first version of all 
three statemachines, statemachine.year2 corresponds to the next iteration, and 
statemachine.year3 corresponds to the last iteration. In all three iterations, 
statemachines for a microwave oven, a cooking hood, and a CD player are 
developed. This directory contains diagram sketches of these statemachines, 
which have the same functionality across all three years.

The sequence of iterations is as follows:
year1: standard object-oriented state machine, one class per state
year2: refactoring into a generic state machine library (similar to Fowler), 
       more compact code and more reuse
year3: internal DSL (aka fluent interface) for building state machines using 
       the generic framework

Where possible, functionality from previous iterations is reused directly.
