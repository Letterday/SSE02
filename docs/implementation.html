    <h2>Implementation patterns</h2>

    The examples provided in this repository can be used as concrete
    examples for understanding some of the implementation patterns
    from Fowler's book on domain-specific languages.

    <h3>Semantic model</h3>

    The semantic model is used in all of the examples, specifically
    you can find it here:
    <ul>

      <li><i>Entity-Relation:</i> The semantic model is described by
	the inner classes <b>EntityType</b> and <b>EntityField</b>,
	all of which cound be found in the
	class <a href="https://github.com/ModularRoboticsLab/SSE02/blob/master/src/entityrelation/EntityRelation.java">entityrelation.EntityRelation</a>.
	The data stored in a concrete entity-relation model is
	described by an instance of the semantic model and is
	represented by the inner class <b>Entity</b></li>
      
      <li><i>QuickGUI:</i> The semantic model is described by the
	inner classes <b>QComponent</b>, <b>QFrame</b>, <b>QPanel</b>,
	and <b>QElement</b>, all of which can be found in the
	class <a href="https://github.com/ModularRoboticsLab/SSE02/blob/master/src/quickqui/QuickGUI.java">quickgui.QuickGUI</a>.
	The semantic model is interpreted to provide a concrete
	instantiation is in the form of a Swing GUI.</li>

      <li><i>Serializer:</i> The semantic model is described by the
	inner classes <b>PacketModel</b>, <b>FieldModel</b>, and its
	concrete
	subclasses <b>IntFieldModel</b>, <b>EnumFieldModel</b>,
	and <b>BooleanFieldModel</b>, all of which can be found in the
	class <a href="https://github.com/ModularRoboticsLab/SSE02/blob/master/src/serializer/PacketFormat.java">serializer.PacketFormat</a>.
	The model is interpreted by
	the <a href="https://github.com/ModularRoboticsLab/SSE02/blob/master/src/serializer/Packetizer.java">Packetizer</a>
	class and stored as raw binary data in the concrete subclasses
	of
	the <a href="https://github.com/ModularRoboticsLab/SSE02/blob/master/src/serializer/Packet.java">Packet</a>
	class.</li>

      <li><i>Statemachine:</i> The semantic model is described by the
      three classes of
      the <a href="https://github.com/ModularRoboticsLab/SSE02/tree/master/src/statemachine/year2/framework">year2</a>
      package: <b>Machine</b>, <b>State</b>, and <b>Transition</b>.
      The model is directly interpreted to give the behavior of the
      state machine.</li>

    </ul>
